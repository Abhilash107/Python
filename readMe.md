Hello, This is a Python language repo
# Python can be used:
- on a server to create web applications.
- alongside software to create workflows.
- handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
- for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.


- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.

# process
- code/script --> Byte Code(mostly hidden) --> PVM(runs the code)
1. Compiles to Byte code
2. Byte code runs faster
3. compiled python ==> .pyc file(frozen binaries)




# PVM - python virtual machine
- run time engine like ( v8 in Js)
- aka python interpreter

# Notes
- Byte code is not machine code
- it's python specific interpretation
- Normal python ==> cPython

# Data types
1. Number : 1234, 3.23, 3+3i, Decimal(), Fraction()
2. String: "", '', "Bob's", b'a\x01c', 
3. List: [1, 2, [9, 8, 7], 3, 4], 
4. Tuple: (1, 'spam', 3, '3'), tuple("hello")
5. Dictionary: {'food': 'spam', 'taste': 'yum'}, dict(hours=10)
6. Set: set('abc'), {'a', 'b', 'c'}
7. File: open('eggs.text')
8. Boolean: True, false
9. None: none
10. Functions, modules, classes
11. Advanced: Decorators, Generators, Iterator, MetaProgramming


# Imp points:
Data types are assigned to the Object/value that is stored not the variable

# Notes:

- In Python, variables defined inside a for or loop (or any loop) are still in the same scope as the rest of the code that surrounds the loop. Python does not create a separate block scope for loops, so variables declared in a loop are available after the loop ends.


- In Python, if-else blocks also do not create a separate block scope, similar to loops. Any variables defined inside an if, elif, or else block will still be accessible outside of these blocks, provided that the block gets executed.
