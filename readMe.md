Hello, This is a Python language repo
# Python can be used:
1. on a server to create web applications.
2. alongside software to create workflows.
3. handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
4. for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.


Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.

# process
code/script --> Byte Code(mostly hidden) --> PVM(runs the code)
1. Compiles to Byte code
2. Byte code runs faster
3. compiled python ==> .pyc file(frozen binaries)


# PVM - python virtual machine
1. run time engine like ( v8 in Js)
2. aka python interpreter

# Notes
1. Byte code is not machine code
2. it's python specific interpretation
3. Normal python ==> cPython
