- Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses algorithms called artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. These neural networks can automatically learn features from large amounts of data without explicit programming. Deep learning is especially powerful for tasks involving images, audio, text, and video, where traditional machine learning methods struggle.

- Image Classification

Imagine you want a computer to recognize whether a picture is of a cat or a dog.

In traditional machine learning, you'd need to manually extract features like ear shape, fur pattern, etc., and feed them into an algorithm.

In deep learning, you feed raw images into a neural network (like a Convolutional Neural Network - CNN), and it automatically learns the features (like edges, textures, shapes) layer by layer to classify the image correctly.


# Models:
Deep learning models are complex and require an extensive mathematical background to understand their inner workings.

Keras is to deep learning as Scikit-learn is to machine learning. Each encapsulates the sophisticated mathematics, so developers need only define, parameterize and manipulate objects.

# Dataset Sizes:
- Deep learning works well when you have lots of data, but it also can be effective for smaller datasets when combined with techniques like transfer learning and data augmentation.

- Transfer learning uses existing knowledge from a previously trained model as the foundation for a new model. 
- Data augmentation adds data to a dataset by deriving new data from existing data.


# Processing Power:
- Deep learning can require significant processing power. Complex models trained on bigdata datasets can take hours, days or even more to train.



# Deep Learning Applications
Deep learning is being used in a wide range of applications, such as:
• Game playing
• Computer vision: Object recognition, pattern recognition, facial recognition
• Self-driving cars
• Robotics
• Improving customer experiences
• Chatbots
• Diagnosing medical conditions
• Google Search
• Facial recognition
• Automated image captioning and video closed captioning
• Enhancing image resolution
• Speech recognition
• Language translation
• Predicting election results
• Predicting earthquakes and weather
• Google Sunroof to determine whether you can put solar panels on your roof
• Generative applications—Generating original images, processing existing images to look like a specified artist’s style, adding color to black-and-white images and video, creating music, creating text (books, poetry) and much more.
