#The single-leading-underscore (_) naming convention indicates that client code should not access _hour directly.
# The @property decorator precedes the property’s getter method, which receives only a self parameter. scenes, a decorator adds code to the decorated function—in
# this case to make the hour function work with attribute syntax. The getter method’s name
# is the property name. This getter method returns the _hour data attribute’s value.


# A decorator of the form @property_name.setter (in this case, @hour.setter) precedes
# the property’s setter method. The method receives two parameters—self and a
# parameter (hour) representing the value being assigned to the property. If the hour parameter’s
# value is valid, this method assigns it to the self object’s _hour attribute

# Using the setter enabled us to validate __init__’s hour argument before creating and initializing
# the object’s _hour attribute, which occurs the first time the hour property’s setter
# executes as a result of line 9. A read-write property has both a getter and a setter. A readonly
# property has only a getter.


# The Python documentation indicates that __repr__ returns the “official” string representation
# of the object. Typically this string looks like a constructor expression that creates
# and initializes the object,2 as in:
# 'Time(hour=6, minute=30, second=0)'


# Python has a built-in function eval that could receive the preceding string as an argument and use
# it to create and initialize a Time object containing values specified in the string.

# __str__ special method. This method is called implicitly when you convert an object to a string with the built-in function str, such as when you print an object or call str explicitly.


#A(n) ______ property has both a getter and setter. If only a getter is provided,
# the property is a(n) ______ property, meaning that you only can get the property’s
# value.
# Answer: read-write, read-only.
