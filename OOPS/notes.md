# 📘 Notes: Crafting Valuable Classes & Object-Based Programming in Python

---

## 🔹 Crafting Valuable Classes

- Learn to create **custom classes** to meet application-specific needs.
- Focus on **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles:
  - Classes
  - Objects
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
- OOP supports better:
  - Design
  - Implementation
  - Testing
  - Debugging
  - Maintenance
- Sections 10.1–10.9 cover hands-on code and concepts.
- Sections 10.10–10.15 (optional): provide additional perspectives and features.

---

## 🔹 Class Libraries and Object-Based Programming

- Most Python OOP is **object-based**, meaning:
  - You **use** existing classes more often than you create new ones.
- Examples:
  - Built-ins: `int`, `str`, `list`, `dict`, etc.
  - Libraries: `Decimal`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `pandas`
- **Class libraries**:
  - Collections of reusable classes.
  - Built by Python open-source community.
  - Encourage **code reuse** (no need to reinvent the wheel).
- Benefits of open-source libraries:
  - Tested
  - Bug-free
  - Performance-optimized
  - Cross-platform
- Sources: GitHub, BitBucket, SourceForge
- Installation: `pip` or `conda`
- A key reason for Python’s popularity.

---

## 🔹 Creating Your Own Custom Classes

- Custom classes = **new data types** (e.g., `CommissionEmployee`, `Time`, `Card`)
- Most personal projects use **few** custom classes.
- Industrial applications may contain **hundreds or thousands**.
- You may contribute classes to the open-source community.
- Organizations often have open-sourcing policies.

---

## 🔹 Inheritance

- Enables **new classes** to inherit features from **existing classes**.
- Promotes **code reuse** and easier maintenance.
- Terms:
  - **Base class / Superclass**: the existing class.
  - **Derived class / Subclass**: the new class.
- You can **customize** inherited behavior as needed.
- Always try to inherit from a base class **close to your needs**.
- Know your **class libraries** to use inheritance effectively.

---

## 🔹 Polymorphism

- Lets you program “in the general” rather than “in the specific.”
- The **same method call** behaves differently based on the object’s type.
- Achieved via:
  - **Inheritance**
  - **Duck typing** (if it behaves like a duck, it *is* a duck)
- Enhances flexibility and reduces code duplication.

---

## 🔹 Case Study: Card-Shuffling-and-Dealing Simulation

- Builds on random number techniques (used in dice rolling/craps).
- Uses **Matplotlib** to display card deck:
  - Before shuffle
  - After shuffle
- Exercises include:
  - Blackjack
  - Solitaire
  - Poker hand evaluator

---

## 🔹 Data Classes (Python 3.7+)

- Allow **concise class creation**.
- Automatically generate:
  - `__init__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, etc.
- Saves time and reduces boilerplate.
- Gaining popularity, though adoption may take time.
- Chapter shows both traditional and new approaches.

# 🔒 Encapsulation in Python

## 🧑‍💻 Client Code
- **Client code** refers to any code that uses objects of a class.
- In many OOP languages (like Java, C++), data can be made truly **private**, inaccessible outside the class.

- In Python, all data attributes are accessible. You use attribute naming conventions
to indicate that attributes should not be accessed directly from client code.
---

## 🚫 No True Private Data in Python
- Python does **not enforce private access** like other languages.
- Instead, it uses **naming conventions** to indicate intended usage.

---

## 🔤 Leading Underscore Naming Convention

| Prefix        | Meaning                             |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `_attribute`  | Internal use only (non-public)       |
| `attribute`   | Public attribute (OK for client use) |

### ✅ By Convention:
- A leading underscore `_` signals: **"Don't touch this unless you know what you're doing."**
- Python will **not stop** you from accessing `_attribute`, but it's **discouraged**.

---

## 🛠️ Proper Access
- Use **methods** (like getters/setters) or **properties** to **interact with internal data**.
- This protects the class’s internal state and maintains **encapsulation**.

---

## 📌 Key Points

- Encapsulation means **hiding internal data** and exposing only what’s necessary.
- Python relies on **developer discipline** via naming conventions.
- The `_` prefix is a **soft privacy** mechanism—not enforced, but respected by convention.

---

## ⏰ Coming Up: Time Class Example
In the next section, we'll define a `Time` class using these conventions and show how encapsulation works in practice.

- The use of a single leading underscore (e.g., _hour, _minute, _second) in this file is a naming convention in Python to indicate that these attributes are intended to be private and should not be accessed directly by client code.

## 10.4



## 10.5:
- Python programmers often use “private” attributes for data or utility methods that are essential to a class’s inner workings but are not part of the class’s public interface.

- Python objects’ attributes are always accessible. However, Python has a naming convention for “private” attributes.

- ***Rather than _hour, we can name the attribute __hour with two leading underscores. This convention indicates that __hour is “private” and should not be accessible to the class’s clients. To help prevent clients from accessing “private” attributes, Python renames them by preceding the attribute name with _ClassName, as in _Time__hour. This is called name mangling***

- If you try assign to __hour, as in wake_up.__hour = 100 Python raises an AttributeError, indicating that the class does not have an __hour attribute.

- Even with double-underscore (__) naming, we can still access and modify __private_data, because we know that Python renames attributes simply by prefixing their names with '_ClassName'. Demonstrate this for class PrivateData’s data attribute __private_data.


## 10.7:

# 📘 Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 🔹 Basic Concepts

- **Inheritance** allows one class (subclass) to acquire the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (base class).
- **Base Class**: A general class (e.g., `Loan`).
- **Subclass**: A more specific class that inherits from the base class (e.g., `CarLoan`).

> 🔸 Example: A `CarLoan` is a `Loan`, but not every `Loan` is a `CarLoan`.

---

## 🔹 General vs Specific

- Base classes are **more general**.
- Subclasses are **more specific**.
- A base class can have **many subclasses**.
- A subclass object **is an** object of its base class.

> 🔸 Example: `Vehicle` is a base class. `Car` is a subclass.
> - A `Car` **is a** `Vehicle`.
> - But not all `Vehicles` are `Cars` (they can be `Boats`, `Trucks`, etc.).

---

## 🔹 Inheritance Hierarchies

Inheritance relationships form **tree-like structures**, also called **inheritance hierarchies**.

### 🏫 CommunityMember Hierarchy

- “is a” vs. “has a”
Inheritance produces “is-a” relationships in which an object of a subclass type may also be treated as an object of the base-class type. You’ve also seen “has-a” (composition) relationships in which a class has references to one or more objects of other classes as members.


## 10.8
# 💼 Inheritance Example: Employee Hierarchy in a Payroll App

## 🔹 Real-World Scenario

In a company's payroll system:
- All employees share common features (like name, ID, etc.).
- Some employees are **commission-based**, earning a percentage of their sales.
- Others are **salaried commission-based**, earning both a base salary and a sales commission.

---

## 🔹 Base Class: CommissionEmployee

Represents general **commission-based employees**.

### Key Traits:
- Paid as a **percentage of their total sales**.
- Contains shared employee details and behavior related to commission earnings.

---

## 🔹 Subclass: SalariedCommissionEmployee

Represents a more specific type of employee:
- Inherits all features from `CommissionEmployee`.
- Additionally receives a **fixed base salary** along with commission.

### Special Behavior:
- Calculates total earnings as **base salary + commission**.
- Overrides the base class’s method to add its own logic.

---

## 🔹 Inheritance Relationship

- `SalariedCommissionEmployee` **is a** `CommissionEmployee`.
- The subclass:
  - **Reuses** the base class’s features.
  - **Extends** the functionality with additional logic.
- This models a real-world "is-a" relationship.

---

## 🔹 Key Learnings

- **Base class** captures general behavior.
- **Subclass** adds more specific behavior.
- Objects of the subclass have:
  - All features of the base class.
  - Their own additional features.
- Inheritance avoids code duplication and enhances code organization.



- *****In Python, you cannot define a setter (@property_name.setter) without first defining the corresponding getter (@property).****


- To inherit from a class, you must first import its definition (line 3). Line 6 class SalariedCommissionEmployee(CommissionEmployee): specifies that class  SalariedCommissionEmployee inherits from CommissionEmployee.

- Each subclass __init__ must explicitly call its base class’s __init__ to initialize the data attributes inherited from the base class. This call should be the first statement in the subclass’s __init__ method.

- The notation super().__init__ uses the built-in function super to locate and call the base class’s __init__ method, passing the five arguments that initialize the inherited data attributes.

- **No, your code will not work as expected because the parent class (CommissionEmployee) uses f_name and l_name as the attribute names for the first and last names, but in the child class (SalariedCommissionEmployee), you are passing first_name and last_name to the parent class constructor. This mismatch will cause an error**

- **The parameter names in the child class must match the parameter names expected by the parent class's __init__ method. Choose consistent naming conventions (f_name/l_name or first_ ame/last_name) across your classes to avoid confusion. If you want to use different names in the child class, you must explicitly map them when calling super().__init__().**

- SalariedCommissionEmployee. The new version obtains the portion of the earnings based on commission alone by calling CommissionEmployee’s earnings method with the expression super().earnings()

- By having SalariedCommissionEmployee’s earnings method invoke CommissionEmployee’s
earnings method to calculate part of a SalariedCommissionEmployee’s earnings,
we avoid duplicating the code and reduce code-maintenance problems.



- **Function isinstance determines whether an object has an “is a” relationship with a specific type. Because SalariedCommissionEmployee inherits from CommissionEmployee, both of the following snippets return True, confirming the “is a” relationship**


# 🧠 Understanding Inheritance and Method Overriding

## 🔹 Key Concept

**Inheritance with method overriding** helps you build new software components based on existing ones, but tailored to your app's needs.

---

## 🔹 Object-Based Programming (OBP)

In the Python world, many powerful libraries already exist. In OBP, your programming style usually involves:

1. Knowing which libraries are available.
2. Finding the right classes.
3. Creating objects from those classes.
4. Calling their methods (sending messages).

This is called **object-based programming** because you're using existing classes and combining them (composition), without changing them.

---

## 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

You move from OBP to **OOP** when you:

- Use **inheritance** to create new classes from existing ones.
- **Override methods** to customize behavior.
- Possibly use **polymorphism** (same method, different behavior depending on object).

Even if you're just composing objects from inherited classes, it still counts as object-oriented programming.

---

## 🔹 Summary

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **OBP** | Use and combine existing class objects. |
| **OOP** | Extend existing classes using inheritance and override methods to fit your needs. |


# 🦆 Duck Typing and Polymorphism in Python

## 🔹 Traditional OOP Languages

In most object-oriented languages:
- **Polymorphism** requires **inheritance** (an “is-a” relationship).
- Objects must be instances of a subclass to be processed polymorphically.

---
## 10.09 Python's Flexibility: Duck Typing

Python allows **polymorphic behavior** without inheritance through a concept called **duck typing**.

> **"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck."**

### What it means:
- Python doesn't check an object's **type**.
- It only checks whether the object has the **method or attribute** you're trying to use.
- If the method exists and can be called correctly, it works — regardless of the class type.

## 10.10 Operator Overloading
What Is It?
Operator overloading allows custom classes to use Python’s built-in operators (+, *, [], etc.) in intuitive ways.

Everyday Uses:
Operator	Built-in Behaviors
- +	Adds numbers, joins strings/lists, adds to each NumPy array element
- []	Access elements in lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries
- *	Multiplies numbers, repeats sequences, scales NumPy arrays
Behind the Scenes:
Operators map to special methods in a class:

Operator	Special Method
+	__add__(self, other)
*	__mul__(self, other)
[]	__getitem__(self, key)
==	__eq__(self, other)
By overriding these in your class, you define how your object interacts with each operator.

🔹 Why Use Operator Overloading?
Makes custom classes easier to use

Enables intuitive syntax

Increases code readability

Integrates well with Python style

✅ Summary
Concept	Key Idea
Inheritance	Reuse and customize behavior across related classes
OBP	Use existing objects via composition
OOP	Extend existing classes with inheritance and overriding
Duck Typing	Behavior-based object handling without inheritance
Operator Overloading	Define custom operator behavior for your classes




## ⚠️ Operator Overloading Restrictions

Although Python allows operator overloading, there are **important restrictions**:

1. **Operator Precedence**  
   - Cannot be changed through overloading.
   - Use parentheses `()` to control evaluation order.

2. **Operator Associativity**  
   - Left-to-right or right-to-left grouping (associativity) **cannot** be changed.

3. **Arity (Number of Operands)**  
   - You cannot change a binary operator (like `+`) into a unary one (like `-x`), or vice versa.

4. **No New Operators**  
   - You can only overload **existing Python operators**.
   - Cannot invent your own symbols (e.g., `%%+>` is invalid).

5. **Built-in Type Behavior is Fixed**  
   - You **cannot** change how built-in types (e.g., `int`, `str`) behave with operators.
   - Example: You can't make `5 + 2` return `1`.

6. **Custom Classes Only**  
   - Operator overloading applies only to:
     - Custom class objects
     - OR custom class + built-in type (e.g., `Vector + 5`)



- **Python prohibits you from creating new operators, and operator overloading cannot change how an operator works with built-in types.**





## 10.11 📌 Exception Class Hierarchy and Custom Exceptions in Python
🔷 Core Concepts
All exceptions in Python are objects of classes that inherit from the base class BaseException.

These classes are defined in the exceptions module (built-in).

🔹 Primary Subclasses of BaseException:
Class	Description
SystemExit	Terminates program execution without producing a traceback.
KeyboardInterrupt	Triggered by user interrupt (e.g., Ctrl + C).
GeneratorExit	Raised when a generator is closed.
Exception	Base class for most common exception types.
📌 Common Subclasses of Exception:
ZeroDivisionError

NameError

ValueError

TypeError

IndexError

KeyError

RuntimeError

AttributeError

StatisticsError (from statistics module)

🧲 Catching Exceptions
You can catch exceptions by their type, or use a base class to catch multiple types.

Catching Exception catches all its subclasses.

❗ Avoid placing a handler for Exception before more specific handlers—others become unreachable.

🧩 Custom Exceptions
Use existing exceptions where possible.

Define custom exceptions only when:

Existing ones don't describe the situation well.

You want to handle them differently.

Custom exceptions should inherit from Exception.

✅ Self Check
Fill-In: Most exceptions inherit from **Exception** and are defined in module **exceptions**.

True/False: You should generally use a new exception class when raising exceptions.
Answer: ❌ False — Prefer existing exception classes.

Namespaces and Scope in Python
Namespaces associate identifiers with objects and are implemented like dictionaries. They define scope and are independent of each other, allowing the same name in different namespaces. Python mainly uses three namespaces: local, global, and built-in.

Local Namespace:
Created when a function/method is called. It holds parameters and local variables, existing only during that function’s execution.

Global Namespace:
Created when a module loads. It holds global variables, functions, and classes, and persists until the program ends. An IPython session has its own global namespace. Modules also have a __name__ identifier (e.g., 'math', '__main__').

Built-in Namespace:
Created when the interpreter starts. It holds built-in functions (like input, print) and types (int, str, etc.) and stays until the program ends.

Identifier Search Order:
When you use a name, Python searches in order: local → global → built-in.
Example:

Inside a function, Python first looks in the local namespace.

If not found, it checks the global namespace.

If still not found, it checks the built-in namespace.

If missing everywhere, it raises a NameError.

Nested Functions (LEGB Rule):
In nested functions, Python searches:
Local → Enclosing → Global → Built-in.

Class Namespace:
Classes have their own namespace storing class attributes. If an attribute isn't found, Python searches parent classes up to the base object.

Object Namespace:
Each object has its own namespace for instance attributes, typically added during __init__.



## 10.16 Time Series and Simple Linear Regression

📊 Time Series & Simple Linear Regression in Python
🔷 What Are Time Series?
A time series is a sequence of values (observations) associated with points in time.

🔸 Examples:
Daily stock prices

Hourly temperature readings

Flight path coordinates over time

Annual crop yields

Quarterly company profits

Twitter stream (timestamped tweets)

🔹 Types of Time Series
Type	Description
Univariate	One observation per time point (e.g., avg January temp per year)
Multivariate	Multiple observations per time point (e.g., temp, humidity, pressure)
📌 Common Time Series Tasks
Task	Description
Time Series Analysis	Discover patterns (e.g., seasonality) in historical data

➕ Independent Variable
Year (e.g., 1895, 1896, …)

➕ Dependent Variable
Avg January high temperature in that year

Time Series and Simple Linear Regression Overview
Time series are sequences of observations associated with specific time points — like daily stock prices, hourly temperatures, or tweets with timestamps.

In this section, we’ll predict NYC’s average January high temperatures from 1895 to 2018 using simple linear regression.

Later, we'll explore time series further:

With scikit-learn in the Machine Learning chapter.

With RNNs in the Deep Learning chapter.

In financial applications and IoT in the Big Data chapter.

We'll use:

Seaborn and pandas (built on Matplotlib) for graphs.

Launch IPython with Matplotlib:

css
Copy
Edit
ipython --matplotlib
Time Series Types
Univariate: One observation per time (e.g., January high temperature each year).

Multivariate: Multiple observations (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure).

Two main tasks:

Time series analysis: Find patterns (like seasonality).

Time series forecasting: Predict future values (our goal here).

Simple Linear Regression
We predict by fitting a straight line:

𝑦
=
𝑚
𝑥
+
𝑏
y=mx+b
where:

𝑚
m = slope

𝑏
b = intercept

𝑥
x = independent variable (year)

𝑦
y = dependent variable (temperature)

Example: Fahrenheit to Celsius is a linear relationship:

𝑐
=
5
9
(
𝑓
−
32
)
c= 
9
5
​
 (f−32)
Using linregress from SciPy’s stats module, we find the best-fit line by minimizing the sum of squared distances (Ordinary Least Squares method).

Data Preparation
Data from NOAA's "Climate at a Glance" portal (1895–2018).

Provided in file: ave_hi_nyc_jan_1895-2018.csv.

Columns:

Date: 'YYYYMM' format (MM is always '01' for January)

Value: Average high temperature (°F)

Anomaly: (Not used)

Steps:

Load CSV into a pandas DataFrame.

Rename 'Value' column to 'Temperature'.

Remove '01' from dates by integer division (floordiv(100)).

Basic Data Analysis
Use describe() to get quick stats:

124 observations.

Mean temp: 37.60°F.

Min: 26.10°F, Max: 47.60°F.

Forecasting
Use linregress:

python
Copy
Edit
from scipy.stats import linregress
linear_regression = linregress(x, y)
Predict temperature for 2019 using:

𝑦
=
(
𝑠
𝑙
𝑜
𝑝
𝑒
×
2019
)
+
𝑖
𝑛
𝑡
𝑒
𝑟
𝑐
𝑒
𝑝
𝑡
y=(slope×2019)+intercept
Similarly, predict for 1890 (before the dataset started).

Note: Predictions far outside 1895–2018 are less reliable.

Visualization
Use Seaborn’s regplot to plot:

Scatter plot of Date vs. Temperature.

Regression line showing warming trend.

Adjust the y-axis (e.g., range 10–70°F) to better visualize the linear relationship.

python
Copy
Edit
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.regplot(x=df.Date, y=df.Temperature)
plt.ylim(10, 70)
plt.show()
Summary:
You learned how to clean, analyze, forecast, and visualize time series data using simple linear regression, pandas, Seaborn, and SciPy.
